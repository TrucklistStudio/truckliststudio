How to use:
-----------

- The main fuctions acts like WebcamStudio, so read the manual in the docs folder to have an idea.
- Drag'n drop your sources (movies, images, music) into the "Sources" panel (the middle one) or use the "Add Media" button.
- Select a source and from the "Source Properties" select the "Track Opt" tab.
- Click on "Make a Track" button to have the source added to the Playlist. (Only Video and Music can become tracks)
- You can also use the "T" icon in the top to have the loaded media added as a track automatically.
- Select a track to start and click on "Play Track" button at the bottom.
- Tracks Layout can be added ( Logos, Text or Animations) Playing them, selecting a Track and Update the Track with the [Update] Button.
- Audio Preview is not activated by default, click the "Mixer" tab, and click the little speaker to activate it.
- Each source has a layer to use. Only one source can be on a layer. If more than one have the same layer,
  only one of them will be displayed.
- To broadcast to VaughnLive or Ustream, download your FME configuration file (XML), and drag'n drop the file in the "Output" panel.
- You may need to tweak the FME file if the broadcasting bitrate is too high for your internet access.
- To remove a "broadcast button", drag it to the right, it will be removed.
- You can save your setup in a .studio file.
- Start with a small setup first (320x240@15fps) before doing the hardcore stuff.
- Have fun!

*******************************************
* TrucklistStudio v1.0 for Windows *
*******************************************

You can find binaries for Windows here:

http://sourceforge.net/projects/truckliststudio/files/Binaries/Beta/Windows/

Windows users should download the proper ffmpeg static binary (Already included in the Windows Archive) and put it in the TrucklistStudio Jar path:

The URL is: http://ffmpeg.zeranoe.com/builds

First make sure you have Java installed and
simply double-click TrucklistStudio.jar icon.

Notes & Troubleshooting:
========================
- It is better to use latest Java 8 jre to avoid permission issues.

- Seems that running the jar from a command line TS got some errors so it is better to run doubleclicking on it.

- In case of permissions issues, try to change properties of the "javaw.exe" file
(Usually located under "C:\Program Files\Java\jre1.x.x\bin") by right clicking on
it and setting "Run as administrator" under "Compatibility" tab. Unfortunatly in
this way you loose the Drag'n'Drop feature ...

Know Bugs under Windows:
========================
- Drag'n'Drop may not work.

For anything feel free to post in TrucklistStudio sf page:

Have a good day.
