Notice:
-------

The projects now are two:
TrucklistStudio 0.x
TrucklistStudioFX 1.x
I suggest you to keep installed only the TrucklistStudio v 0.x because the FX interface is quite heavy for the CPU.
So if you add the TrucklistStudioFX 1.x PPA repository please remove it because is in conflict with the normal TrucklistStudio 0.x version.

1) Install ppa-purge
$ sudo apt-get install ppa-purge
2) Remove TrucklistStudioFX 1.x PPA:
$ sudo ppa-purge ppa:soylent-tv/truckliststudiofx
3) Wait until command is finished. This will remove both Truckliststudio and TruckliststudioFX if installed.
4) Reinstall only TrucklistStudio 0.x:
$ sudo apt-get install truckliststudio

How to use:
-----------

- The main fuctions acts like WebcamStudio, so read the manual in the docs folder to have an idea.
- Drag'n drop your sources (movies, images, music) into the "Sources" panel (the middle one) or use the "Add Media" button.
- Select a source and from the "Source Properties" select the "Track Opt" tab.
- Click on "Make a Track" button to have the source added to the Playlist. (Only Video and Music can become tracks)
- You can also use the "T" icon in the top to have the loaded media added as a track automatically.
- Select a track to start and click on "Play Track" button at the bottom.
- Tracks Layout can be added ( Logos, Text or Animations) Playing them, selecting a Track and Update the Track with the [Up/Down] Button.
- Audio Preview is not activated by default, click the "Mixer" tab, and click the little speaker to activate it.
  Carefull with audio feedback!
- Each source has a layer to use. Only one source can be on a layer. If more than one have the same layer,
  only one of them will be displayed.
- "Record" button will record audio and video into a selected file. AVI, FLV, OGG are well supported.
  MPG cannot be used at the moment. WebM needs some tweaks.
- To broadcast to Justin.tv or Bambuser, download your FME configuration file (XML), and drag'n drop the file in the "Output" panel.
- You may need to tweak the FME file if the broadcasting bitrate is too high for your internet access.
- To remove a "broadcast button", drag it to the right, it will be removed.
- You can save your setup in a Studio file in this version.
- For high res mixing (640x480), you should use a compiled version of FFMPEG/AVCONV on your computer.  This really helps the encoding part!
- Start with a small setup first (320x240@15fps) before doing the hardcore stuff.
- This version is mostly stable under linux.
- Have fun!


Some testing to do:
-------------------

- Add an FME file to broadcast to Justin.tv, Bambuser, Ustream or VaughnTv (IceCast2, Nginx and Red5 are also supported)

*******************************************
* TrucklistStudio v0.9 (Beta) for Windows *
*******************************************

You can find binaries for Windows here:

http://sourceforge.net/projects/truckliststudio/files/Binaries/Beta/Windows/

Windows users should download the proper ffmpeg static binary (Already included in the Windows Archive) and put it in the TrucklistStudio Jar path:

The URL is: http://ffmpeg.zeranoe.com/builds

For Windows GStreamer FME Output backend support. 
1) You have to install GStreamer binary for Windows before starting TS, you can find it here:
   http://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/data/pkg/windows

2) Choose your architecture msi:
   - gstreamer-1.0-x86-1.8.x.msi
   - gstreamer-1.0-x86_64-1.8.x.msi

3) Choose "Complete" Installation and do not change the default installation dir.
   TS will automatically detect the executables.

First make sure you have Java installed and
simply double-click TrucklistStudio.jar icon.

Notes & Troubleshooting:
========================
- It is better to use latest Java 8 jre to avoid permission issues.

- Seems that running the jar from a command line TS got some errors so it is better to run doubleclicking on it.

- In case of permissions issues, try to change properties of the "javaw.exe" file
(Usually located under "C:\Program Files\Java\jre1.x.x\bin") by right clicking on
it and setting "Run as administrator" under "Compatibility" tab. Unfortunatly in
this way you loose the Drag'n'Drop feature ...

Know Bugs under Windows:
========================
- Drag'n'Drop may not work.
