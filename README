TrucklistStudio v1.2.x
======================
You can Load TrucklistStudioFX v1.x studios (.studiofx) but you will loose Text foreground and background colors.
This version is Windows compatible.

Linux:
======
On Ubuntu/Debian you can use the TrucklistStudio PPA repository for versions 14.04 - 16.04 - 17.04 - 17.10 - 18.04

$ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:soylent-tv/truckliststudio
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install truckliststudio

It is also included an Ubuntu 14.04 Trusty build, but before trying to install you have to add the Openjdk-8 PPA,
because for 14.04 there isn't any Java 8 OpenJDK official release in the default repos.

So if you want to use TrucklistStudio PPA for Trusty do the following:
1) Add the Openjdk-8 PPA:
$ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:openjdk-r/ppa
2) Refresh the sources.
$ sudo apt-get update
3) Add TrucklistStudio PPA:
$ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:soylent-tv/truckliststudio
4) Refresh the sources.
$ sudo apt-get update
5) Install TrucklistStudio:
$ sudo apt-get install truckliststudio
6) Finally if you have more than one version of Java installed you may have to set the OS to use Openjdk-8 per default by issuing the command:

$ sudo update-alternatives --config java

from the terminal and choosing the correct option ( number ) that refers to:
/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk/jre/bin/java

You can also use Oracle Java8 instead of OpenJDK8:

To install Java 8:
$ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:webupd8team/java
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install oracle-java8-installer

To set it as default:
$ sudo apt-get install oracle-java8-set-default

To switch between Installed Java versions:
$ sudo update-alternatives --config java

... and select the java runtime you want from the list.

To run TrucklistStudio extract the content of the zip file to a folder, open a terminal and navigate to it (TS folder)
and then type:
$ java -jar TrucklistStudio.jar
If you run into memory Issues try to set the initial Java Heap memory size to 1Gb:
$ java -jar -Xms1000m TrucklistStudio.jar

If you use other Linux Distros, you can always have a look at TrucklistStudio/WebcamStudio README for packages dependences:

https://github.com/WebcamStudio/webcamstudio
https://github.com/TrucklistStudio/truckliststudio

Remember to use Oracle Java8 or Openjdk-8.

Windows:
========
- Download and install Java 8 jre:
  https://www.java.com/en/download/

NB: I noticed that if you have an x86-64 Windows 10 system it is better to install Java 64bit
to avoid memory issues.

https://www.java.com/en/download/manual.jsp

Choose:
Windows Offline (64-bit)

- FFmpeg for Windows are already present in this archive. You can always download the latest version from here (Static Version): 

http://ffmpeg.zeranoe.com/builds/

... and copy the needed executable in the TrucklistStudio TS folder.

For Windows download the latest jars files from:

https://sourceforge.net/projects/truckliststudio/

- To run TrucklistStudio extract the content of the zip file to a folder, open the folder and doubleclick
on TrucklistStudio.jar icon.

TrucklistStudio commad line:
==============================

Navigate in the folder where you extracted the zip archive and type:

java -jar TrucklistStudio.jar [.studio file] -o [Output] -autoplay -remote

Explanation:
------------
[.studio file] --> The studio file that will be automatically loaded at start.

- o [Output] --> The Output button that will be enabled automatically at start.
To specify the Output you will use the first name of the device (Case Sensitive):
Ex:
[ UDP - Audio - Ustream - Vaughn - IceCast - ...]
Naturally you must have the related button already added to TS.

- autoplay --> Will automatically start the first Track of the .studio file.

- remote --> Will automatically enable the Remote-Control at start.

Example:

$ java -jar TrucklistStudio.jar /home/karl/Videos/Test.studio -o UDP -autoplay -remote

Any feedback is very appreciated. :)
