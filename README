TrucklistStudio 0.7
*******************

Hello and welcome to TrucklistStudio by Karl Ellis.
This software is a fork from WebcamStudio by Patrick Balleux.
This release is a buggy and unstable one, so be gentle.


What you need:
--------------
- Java >= 1.7
- AVCONV - FFMPEG - Windows users should download the proper ffmpeg static binary and put it in their PATH.
  The URL is: http://ffmpeg.zeranoe.com/builds
- Some patience ;)


How to use:
-----------

- The main fuctions acts like WebcamStudio, so read the manual in the docs folder to have an idea.
- Drag'n drop your sources (movies, images, music) into the "Sources" panel (the middle one) or use the "Add Media" button.
- Select a source and from the "Source Properties" select the "Track Opt" tab.
- Click on "Make a Track" button to have the source added to the Playlist. (Only Video and Music can become tracks)
- You can also use the "T" icon in the top to have the loaded media added as a track automatically.
- Select a track to start and click on "Play Track" button at the bottom.
- Tracks Layout can be added ( Logos, Text or Animations) Playing them, selecting a Track and Update the Track with the [Up/Down] Button.
- Audio Preview is not activated by default, click the "Mixer" tab, and click the little speaker to activate it.
  Carefull with audio feedback!
- Each source has a layer to use. Only one source can be on a layer. If more than one have the same layer,
  only one of them will be displayed.
- "Record" button will record audio and video into a selected file. AVI, FLV, OGG are well supported.
  MPG cannot be used at the moment. WebM needs some tweaks.
- To broadcast to Justin.tv or Bambuser, download your FME configuration file (XML), and drag'n drop the file in the "Output" panel.
- You may need to tweak the FME file if the broadcasting bitrate is too high for your internet access.
- To remove a "broadcast button", drag it to the right, it will be removed.
- You can save your setup in a Studio file in this version.
- For high res mixing (640x480), you should use a compiled version of FFMPEG/AVCONV on your computer.  This really helps the encoding part!
- Start with a small setup first (320x240@15fps) before doing the hardcore stuff.
- This version is mostly stable under linux.  Windows need more testing.
- Have fun!


Some testing to do:
-------------------

- Add an FME file to broadcast to Justin.tv, Bambuser, Ustream or VaughnTv (IceCast and Red5 are also supported)
